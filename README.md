## Inspiration

The other day we were having a throw back Thursday moment and remembered all of our favourite vintage games and cartoon. We were looking for these and it took us a while to find them, so we got the idea to write all of our favourite retro games, put them all in the same website and add to the website our findings regarding our favourite retro cartoons!

## What it does

This vintage looking website runs your favourite retro games and lets you watch your favourite childhood TV shows.

## How I built it

We used HMTL and CSS for the front-end part, and all the games are written only using Javascript.

## Challenges I ran into

-When we started we didn't have a designer in our team, so we made a webpage without thinking design and ran into very bad layout. Later with help of one of the member, we overcome that problem.

## What I learned
- How to work in a team project.
- Working in different time zones.
- Writing media queries for mobile responsive site.

# What's next for Retricia
- Adding feature to connect with friends and able to play multi player-games.
- chat for in-game.
- Taking user feedback and work on it.
